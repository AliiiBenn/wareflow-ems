# Documentation Introduction

This is the official CustomTkinter documentation, where you can find detailed information on all available widgets and some more information on how the themes and the appearance mode works.

Feel free to ask questions in the Github Discussion tab when something is unclear, if you need help with a project or if you want to show off your project made with CustomTkinter.

If you found a bug, please report it in the Github Issues tab and provide the complete error message and a minimal example code that reproduces the error.

If you have ideas on improvements or requests for new widgets, you can also report these in the Github Issues tab, but please inform yourself about previous requests to prevent duplicates.
